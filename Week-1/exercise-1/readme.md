=> The main functionality of a web browser is to display and navigate through web pages on the Internet. It allows users to enter a web address (URL) or search query and retrieve the corresponding web page, which can include text, images, videos, and other multimedia content.

=> When a user enters a URL into a browser, the browser sends a request to the server associated with the domain specified in the URL. The server then looks up the requested resource, such as a web page or image, and sends it back to the browser in the form of an HTTP response. The browser then renders the content of the response, such as displaying a web page or an image, for the user to view.

=>  A web browser is typically composed of several high-level components, including:

 1 - User Interface: This is the part of the browser that the user interacts with, including the address bar, navigation buttons, and menu options.

 2 - Rendering Engine: This component is responsible for displaying the web page on the user's screen. It interprets and displays the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code that makes  up the web page.

 3 - Networking: This component handles all the network communication, such as sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses, and handling cookies and other network-related data.

 4 - JavaScript Interpreter: This component is responsible for interpreting and executing any JavaScript code on the web page.

 5 - Document Object Model (DOM): This component represents the web page in a hierarchical tree structure, making it easy for the browser to manipulate and access the elements of the page.

 6 - Security features: Some browsers have features such as same-origin policy, same-site cookies, and content security policy.

 7 - Extension and Add-ons: Some browsers allow users to install additional functionality, such as ad-blockers, password managers, and other tools, through the use of extensions and add-ons.


=>  A rendering engine is a component of a web browser that is responsible for displaying web content on the user's screen. It takes the code of a web page, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and converts it into a visually rendered page. The rendering engine is responsible for interpreting the code and applying the styles and layout to create the final page that the user sees.

One of the main uses of the rendering engine is to accurately display web pages as intended by the website developer. It also enables the browser to correctly display multimedia content, such as images, videos and animations. Additionally, the rendering engine enables the browser to support web standards and technologies, such as HTML5 and CSS3, which are used to create modern and interactive web pages.


=>  Parsers are a component of a web browser's rendering engine that are responsible for interpreting and analyzing the code of a web page. They are used to convert the raw code of a web page, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, into a format that can be rendered and displayed on the user's screen.

  1 - HTML Parser: An HTML parser is responsible for analyzing the HTML code of a web page and creating a Document Object Model (DOM) that represents the structure of the page. The DOM is a tree-like representation of the elements and their relationships on the page.

  2 - CSS Parser: A CSS parser is responsible for analyzing the CSS code of a web page and creating a CSS Object Model (CSSOM) that represents the styles and layout of the page. The CSSOM is used to apply the styles to the elements of the DOM.

  3 - JavaScript Parser: A JavaScript parser is responsible for analyzing the JavaScript code of a web page and creating an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that represents the logic and functionality of the script. The AST is used to execute the JavaScript code.

  4 - These Parsers work together to create a final representation of the web page that can be rendered and displayed on the user's screen. The HTML parser creates the structure of the page, the CSS parser applies the styles, and the JavaScript parser adds interactivity and functionality to the page.


=>  Script processors are software programs that are designed to manipulate and process text. They can be used for a variety of tasks such as text manipulation, data extraction, text analysis, and natural language processing. Some common examples of script processors include Python, Perl, and JavaScript. They can be used to automate repetitive tasks, extract information from text, and analyze large amounts of data. Additionally, script processors can be used to create scripts for web scraping, data mining, and other data-related tasks.

=>  Browser tree construction refers to the process by which a web browser parses and organizes the elements of an HTML document into a tree-like structure. This structure, also known as the Document Object Model (DOM), is used to represent the relationships between different elements of the page, such as the headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

The process begins by the browser receiving the HTML document from the web server. The browser then starts parsing the HTML, which is a process of breaking down the HTML code into individual elements and their attributes. As the browser parses the HTML, it creates the nodes of the tree, with the root node being the <html> element. Each element in the HTML is represented by a corresponding node in the tree, and the relationships between the elements are represented by the parent-child relationships between the nodes.

Once the tree is constructed, the browser can use it to render the page and respond to user interactions. It also allows developers to access and manipulate the elements of the page via JavaScript or other scripting languages.

In short, Tree construction is the process of creating a tree-like data structure that represents the elements of an HTML document. The tree is used to render the page, respond to user interactions and to manipulate the elements of the page.
